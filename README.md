# Analysis of a Potential Relationship Between Suicides and Happiness Scores

This is a data analysis project that aims to empirically explore the intuition that happy people do not commit suicide and vice-versa.

This repository has 3 primary data files:

1. <code>suicide.csv</code>
2. <code>Happiness_Suicide.csv</code>
3. <code>- train US new.csv</code>

By cleaning and merging this data we've created two datasets:

1. <code>suicide_cleaned.csv</code>
2. <code>Happiness_cleaned.csv</code>
   Note: The files used to create these files have the same name

<code>Age_Proportions.csv</code> is the file that has the data about the age-group split of various countries.

Our Final Report can be generated using FinalReport.Rmd and is complied in the FinalReport.html file.

Thanks for reading.
